/**
 * Story-line based reasoning. This had been introduced in 2016 to act as a
 * shortcut into genuinely anthropomorphic reasoning. Instead of operating at
 * the level of individual VIs, it assumes the genuine existence of a distinguishable
 * "story" in human reasoning instead of the complex intermixing of events. 
 * 
 * I don't think that this is strictly speaking correct, but it surely simplifies a 
 * lot of things.
