This package contains representations of Xapagy entities which are collections of XapagyComponents.

The WeightedSet and its specializations into InstanceSet and ViSet were the original objects of this
kind. They have been used for Focus, AM and various other components. These components allow direct
setting of a single value.  

On March 31, 2014 a decision had been made that for the success of the ShadowEnergy model, try to make
generic objects which:
   - have additive energy representations 
   - have different energy ``colors''
   - can be read out on the logistic scale (possibly tweaked)
   - have their own model of garbage collecting
   - have their own model of tracking changes (quantums)

So we moved here the ShadowEnergy components, and during April 2014, plan to refactor the
other components.
